# Java Tutorial - JSP, Servlets, and JSTL<hr>This repository has three projects, the jspdemo showing basic JSP functionality, servletdemo which shows how to use JSP and servlets together, and tagdemo which shows common JSTL tags and how they work with JSP/servlets.<br>These projects are leftover from some web dev tutorial I watched a few months ago. Unfortunately, I don't recall who the webseries belonged to, nor can I find the link.<br> ### These projects are merely for documentation purposes to show these concepts in live action!
